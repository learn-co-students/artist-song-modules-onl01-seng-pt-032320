# # Let's define our module. Create a concerns folder inside lib.
# This is where we'll store our modules. It is a common practice to create a folder
# called concerns that holds modules that will be used across classes in an object oriented Ruby project.

#
# Important! Remember to add require_relative '../lib/concerns/memorable' to your environment file before running any tests.

# Once you define the two class methods mentioned above inside of the Memorable module, use the extend keyword to extend those methods,
# as class methods, into both the Artist and Song class. Refer to the previous code along exercise for help. Remember that the self keyword
# is omitted when defining class methods inside modules. The extend keyword is responsible for defining the method as a class method vs. an
# instance method (which would use the include keyword).

module Memorable

  module ClassMethods
    def self.reset_all
      self.all.clear
    end

    def self.count
      self.all.count
    end
  end

  module InstanceMethods

    def initialize
      self.class.all << self
    end
  end
end
